## Deep learning for COVID-19 diagnosis 
### INFORMS QSR Data Challenge 2020

We develop and apply a "Bootstrap ResNet" to classify CT images to help diagnose COVID-19 patients. The bootstrap neural network architecture allows to achieve high out-of-sample performance and to provide a confidence interval for its predictions.
