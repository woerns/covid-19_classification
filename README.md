## Deep learning for COVID-19 diagnosis 
### INFORMS QSR Data Challenge 2020

Data challenge description is available [here](https://connect.informs.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=953f3ec3-7d2d-9097-de0c-231d9b820505) and [here](https://connect.informs.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=f404f7b8-fcd6-75d5-f7a7-d262eab132e7).

We develop and apply a "Bootstrap ResNet" to classify CT images to help diagnose COVID-19 patients. The bootstrap neural network architecture allows to achieve high out-of-sample performance and to provide a confidence interval for its predictions.
